                        compelling stories told
                        through animation has earned the company a deserved worldwide reputation.
                        Their award-winning work produces a unique brand of independent film alongside
                        work for broadcast and advertising spots. The studio has had ten Oscar®
                        nominations and has won four.
                        <br>
                        <br>Peter Lord and David Sproxton began their animating partnership at school.
                        In 1972 they registered the name Aardman Animations. After graduating,
                        they moved to Bristol in 1976 where they produced their first professional
                        production, creating Morph for the children’s program 'Take Hart'.</h3>

                        audience for model animation. Conversation Pieces commissioned by Channel
                        Four Television in 1982 enabled the pair to develop its innovative technique
                        of animating puppet characters to real-life conversations. With films like
                        Early Bird (set in a local radio station) Aardman demonstrated that real
                        people could be characterised with insight, humour and sensitivity.</h3>
